				<h2>What is Blockchain?</h2>
				<div class="text">
					<h4>Simply put, a blockchain is a database.</h4><br><br>
					<p>However, there is huge difference between a traditional database and a blockchain database.</p><br>
					<p>In most cases, a traditional database sits on one computer or in one location.</p><br>
					<p>Even if a company has redundant servers around the world, the data might only be backed up between 3 to 5 locations. On top of that, these companies collectively spend billions of dollars a year on cyber security, to protect this data.</p><br>
					<p>With a blockchain database, the data might be spread on potentially thousands of computers, called nodes, all over the world. The information in these databases is heavily encrypted and sometimes files are broken up into pieces, so even if one piece is exposed, it will not expose the entire file.​</p><br>
					<p>A blockchain is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. Each block typically contains a hash pointer as a link to a previous block, a timestamp and transaction data. By design, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data. A blockchain can serve as "an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way. For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires collusion of the network majority.</p><br>
					<p>Because the blockchain is a chain of blocks cryptographically linked together, if someone decides to cheat the network and claim that they have more coins than they actually have, they would need to alter a transaction made in a previous block. This would break the cryptographic link between the blocks in the blockchain and because everyone else has a copy of the blockchain, everyone else would be able to detect this fraud, because the cryptographic links would not match.</p><br>
					<p>Blockchains are secure by design and are an example of a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance. Decentralized consensus has therefore been achieved with a blockchain. This makes blockchains potentially suitable for the recording of events, medical records, and other records management activities, such as identity management, transaction processing, documenting provenance, or food traceability.</p>

				<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
				<div class="text">
					<h3><em>Blockchain is to Bitcoin, what the internet is to email. A big electronic system,
					on top of which you can build applications.</em></h3><br>
					<p>Bitcoin is a decentralized and transparent peer-to-peer network with an open-source protocol, which was created by a developer or a group of developers named Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi Nakamoto is a pseudonym and no one knows for sure who this person or group of people is.</p><br>
					<p>Bitcoin was invented in 2008 with the publication of a paper titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”. Satoshi Nakamoto combined several prior inventions such as b-money and HashCash to create a completely de-centralized electronic cash system that does not rely on a central authority for currency issuance or settlement and validation of transactions. The key innovation was to use a distributed computation system (called a “Proof-Of-Work” algorithm) to conduct a global “election” every 10 minutes, allowing the de-centralized network to arrive at consensus about the state of transactions. This elegantly solves the issue of double-spend (also known as the "Byzantine fault tolerance" problem) where a single currency unit can be spent twice.</p><br>
					<p>Bitcoin is a collection of concepts and technologies that form the basis of a digital money ecosystem. Units of currency called bitcoins are used to store and transmit value among participants in the bitcoin network. Bitcoin users communicate with each other using the bitcoin protocol primarily via the Internet, although other transport networks can also be used. Users can transfer bitcoin over the network to do just about anything that can be done with conventional currencies, such as buy and sell goods, send money to people or organizations, or extend credit. Bitcoin technology includes features that are based on encryption and digital signatures to ensure the security of the bitcoin network. Bitcoins can be purchased, sold and exchanged for other currencies at specialized currency exchanges. Bitcoin in a sense is the perfect form of money for the Internet because it is fast, secure, and borderless. Users of bitcoin own keys which allow them to prove ownership of transactions in the bitcoin network, unlocking the value to spend it and transfer it to a new recipient. Those keys are often stored in a digital wallet on each user’s computer. Possession of the key that unlocks a transaction is the only prerequisite to spending bitcoins, putting the control entirely in the hands of each user.</p><br>
					<p>Bitcoin is a fully-distributed, peer-to-peer system. As such there is no “central” server or point of control. Bitcoins are created through a process called “mining”, which involves looking for a solution to a difficult problem. Any participant in the bitcoin network (i.e., any device running the full bitcoin protocol stack) may operate as a miner, using their computer’s processing power to attempt to find solutions to this problem. Every 10 minutes on average, a new solution is found by someone who then is able to validate the transactions of the past 10 minutes and is rewarded with brand new bitcoins. Essentially, bitcoin mining de-centralizes the currency-issuance and clearing functions of a central bank and replaces the need for any central bank with this global competition. The bitcoin protocol includes built-in algorithms that regulate the mining function across the network. The difficulty of the problem that miners must solve is adjusted dynamically so that, on average, someone finds a correct answer every 10 minutes regardless of how many miners (and CPUs) are working on the problem at any moment.</p><br>
					<p>Satoshi Nakamoto withdrew from the public in April of 2011, leaving the responsibility of developing the code and network to a thriving group of volunteers. Neither Satoshi Nakamoto nor anyone else exerts control over the bitcoin system, which operates based on fully transparent mathematical principles. The invention itself is groundbreaking and has already spawned new science in the fields of distributed computing, economics and econometrics.</p>

				<h2>Ethereum</h2>
				<div class="text">
					<h3><em>Is Ethereum similar to Bitcoin? Well, sort of, but not really.</em></h3><br>
					<p>Although commonly associated with Bitcoin, blockchain technology has many other applications that go way beyond digital currencies. In fact, Bitcoin is only one of several hundred applications that use blockchain technology today.</p>
					<p>Until relatively recently, building blockchain applications has required a complex background in coding, cryptography, mathematics as well as significant resources. But times have changed. Previously unimagined applications, from electronic voting &amp; digitally recorded property assets to regulatory compliance &amp; trading are now actively being developed and deployed faster than ever before. By providing developers with the tools to build decentralized applications, Ethereum is making all of this possible.</p>
					<p>At its simplest, Ethereum is an open software platform based on blockchain technology that enables developers to build and deploy decentralized applications.​ Like Bitcoin, Ethereum is a distributed public blockchain network. Although there are some significant technical differences between the two, the most important distinction to note is that Bitcoin and Ethereum differ substantially in purpose and capability. Bitcoin offers one particular application of blockchain technology, a peer to peer electronic cash system that enables online Bitcoin payments. While the Bitcoin blockchain is used to track ownership of digital currency (bitcoins), the Ethereum blockchain focuses on running the programming code of any decentralized application.</p>
					<p>In the Ethereum blockchain, instead of mining for bitcoin, miners work to earn Ether, a type of crypto token that fuels the network. Beyond a tradeable cryptocurrency, Ether is also used by application developers to pay for transaction fees and services on the Ethereum network.</p>
					<p>The core element, which makes Ethereum unique is the Smart Contract. Smart contract is just a phrase used to describe computer code that can facilitate the exchange of money, content, property, shares, or anything of value. When running on the blockchain a smart contract becomes like a self-operating computer program that automatically executes when specific conditions are met. Because smart contracts run on the blockchain, they run exactly as programmed without any possibility of censorship, downtime, fraud or third party interference.</p>

Because smart contracts run on the blockchain, they run exactly as programmed without any possibility of censorship, downtime, fraud or third party interference.​</p>
					<p>While all blockchains have the ability to process code, most are severely limited. Ethereum is different. Rather than giving a set of limited operations, Ethereum allows developers to create whatever operations they want. This means developers can build thousands of different applications that go way beyond anything we have seen before.</p>

					<div>Before the creation of Ethereum, blockchain applications were designed to do a very limited set of operations. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, for example, were developed exclusively to operate as peer-to-peer digital currencies. So developers faced a problem. Either expand the set of functions offered by Bitcoin and other types of applications, which is very complicated and time-consuming, or develop a new blockchain application and an entirely new platform as well. Recognizing this predicament, Ethereum’s creator, Vitalik Buterin developed a new approach.</div>
					Ethereum’s core innovation, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a Turing complete software that runs on the Ethereum network. It enables anyone to run any program, regardless of the programming language given enough time and memory. The Ethereum Virtual Machine makes the process of creating blockchain applications much easier and efficient than ever before. Instead of having to build an entirely original blockchain for each new application, Ethereum enables the development of potentially thousands of different applications all on one platform.</p>

					<h3>What can Ethereum be used for?</h3>

					<p>Ethereum enables developers to build and deploy decentralized applications. A decentralized application or Dapp serve some particular purpose to its users. Bitcoin, for example, is a Dapp that provides its users with a peer to peer electronic cash system that enables online Bitcoin payments. Because decentralized applications are made up of code that runs on a blockchain network, they are not controlled by any individual or central entity.</p>
					<p>Any services that are centralized can be decentralized using Ethereum. Think about all the intermediary services that exist across hundreds of different industries. From obvious services like loans provided by banks to intermediary services rarely thought about by most people like title registries, voting systems, regulatory compliance and much more.</p>
					<p>Ethereum can also be used to build Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO). A DAO is fully autonomous, decentralized organization with no single leader. DAO’s are run by programming code, on a collection of smart contracts written on the Ethereum blockchain. The code is designed to replace the rules and structure of a traditional organization, eliminating the need for people and centralized control. A DAO is owned by everyone who purchases tokens, but instead of each token equating to equity shares &amp; ownership, tokens act as contributions that give people voting rights.</p>

					<h3>What are the benefits of Ethereum decentralized Platform?</h3>

					<ul class="eth-benefits">Because decentralized applications run on the blockchain, they benefit from all of its properties.
					<li><span class="eth-benefits-list">Immutability</span> – A third party cannot make any changes to data.</li>
					<li><span class="eth-benefits-list">Corruption &amp; tamper proof</span> – apps are based on a network formed around the principle of consensus, making censorship impossible.</li>
					<li><span class="eth-benefits-list">Secure</span> – With no central point of failure and secured using cryptography, applications are well protected against hacking attacks and fraudulent activities.</li>
					<li><span class="eth-benefits-list">Zero downtime</span> – Apps never go down and can never be switched off.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>What’s the downside of decentralized applications?</h3>

					<p>Despite bringing a number of benefits, decentralized applications aren’t faultless. Because smart contract code is written by humans, smart contracts are only as good as the people who write them. Code bugs or oversights can lead to unintended adverse actions being taken. If a mistake in the code gets exploited, there is no efficient way in which an attack or exploitation can be stopped other than obtaining a network consensus and rewriting the underlying code. This goes against the essence of the blockchain which is meant to be immutable. Also, any action taken by a central party raises serious questions about the decentralized nature of an application.</p>
